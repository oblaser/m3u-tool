# M3U Tool

A tool to convert/modify M3U files, export (copy) all files of a playlist to a
directory and create scripts to download streams ([Legal Notices](#legal-notices)).

# Legal Notices

Be aware that downloading internet streams is illegal in most countries. In
Switzerland, where I live, we have special import taxes on blank storage medias,
which allows us to download and copy audio and video content (for private use
only!).
